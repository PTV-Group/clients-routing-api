 * The engine type of the vehicle.
 * When changing the engine type further parameters must be specified to define a valid vehicle and to
 * obtain proper results. For a hybrid or an electric vehicle **electricityType** and **averageElectricityConsumption**
 * must be specified, for a hybrid vehicle additionally the **hybridRatio**.
 * 
 * This and all dependent parameters cannot be used with a model of an electric vehicle, because all applicable 
 * parameters are automatically provided by the model.
 * Please refer to the [concept](./concepts/model-based-ev-consumption-calculation) to see specifically which 
 * parameters are not compatible and automatically set from the vehicle model.
 * 
 * Relevant for `toll`, `emissions`.
