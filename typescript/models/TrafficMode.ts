/**
 * Defines how to consider traffic in a route calculation.
 *  * `REALISTIC` - Returns the most realistic **travelTime** and **distance** for the selected vehicle and the
 *  given **startTime** or **arrivalTime** (or the current time if none of them is specified).
 *  Takes into account the live traffic situation such as traffic jams or road works
 *  as well as the typical traffic situation at the time of day and the day of week of travel such as the rushhour
 *  on Monday morning or light traffic on Saturday evening.
 *  * `AVERAGE` - Returns the average **travelTime** and **distance** for the selected vehicle.
 *  If **startTime** or **arrivalTime** is specified, the typical traffic situation for that time of day and day of week will be considered such as the rushhour
 *  on Monday morning or light traffic on Saturday evening. Toll will be calculated according to that date and time.
 *  If none of them is specified the typical traffic situation will not be considered, and **travelTime** and **distance** are an average independent of when to travel.
 *  Toll will be calculated for an arbitrary Monday at noon.
 * 
 * See [here](./Concepts/Traffic%20Modes.htm) for more information.
 * This parameter will be ignored for non-motorized profiles such as _BICYCLE_ or _PEDESTRIAN_.
