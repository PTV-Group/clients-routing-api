If **referenceTime** is specified, the typical traffic situation for that time of day and day of week will be considered such as the rushhour  on Monday morning or light traffic on Saturday evening.  If no **referenceTime** is specified the typical traffic situation will not be considered, and **travelTime** and **distance** are an average independent of when to travel.  See [here](./concepts/traffic-modes) for more information. This parameter will be ignored for non-motorized profiles such as _BICYCLE_ or _PEDESTRIAN_.
