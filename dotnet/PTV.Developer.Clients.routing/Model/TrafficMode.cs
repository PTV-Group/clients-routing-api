Takes into account the live traffic situation such as traffic jams or road works  as well as the typical traffic situation at the time of day and the day of week of travel such as the rush-hour  on Monday morning or light traffic on Saturday evening.  * &#x60;AVERAGE&#x60; - Returns the average **travelTime** and **distance** for the selected vehicle.  If **startTime** or **arrivalTime** is specified, the typical traffic situation for that time of day and day of week will be considered such as the rush-hour  on Monday morning or light traffic on Saturday evening. Toll will be calculated according to that date and time.  If none of them is specified the typical traffic situation will not be considered, and **travelTime** and **distance** are an average independent of when to travel.  Toll will be calculated for an arbitrary Monday at noon.  See [here](./concepts/traffic-modes) for more information. This parameter will be ignored for non-motorized profiles such as _BICYCLE_ or _PEDESTRIAN_.
