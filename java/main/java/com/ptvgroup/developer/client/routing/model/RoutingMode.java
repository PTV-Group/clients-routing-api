/**
 * Specifies which objective function should be used for the route calculation.   * _FAST_ is the default which returns a route considering a tradeoff between distance and travel time. All vehicle-specific restrictions are properly considered and violated only, if no other route can be found. * _SHORT_ returns a route which is probably shorter but accepting longer travel times. The resulting route is still sensible and can be driven with the given vehicle, but it may disregard restrictions like driving through residential areas. * _MONETARY_ assigns monetary costs to each road segment according the provided cost parameters and the vehicles properties like its consumption. Furthermore, toll costs are integrated as well. See [here](./concepts/monetary-costs) for more information.
